             you donâ€™t have one make sure to fluff your flour and spoon it into your measuring cup.
              Add the room temperature butter to the bowl of your stand mixer.</li>
        <li>. Cream the butter and sugar together until lighter in color and fluffy in consistency. </li>
        <li>. Add the egg yolks and mix until fully combined.</li>
        <li>.Add the flour and mix until just incorporated.</li>
        <li>Roll the cookie dough into a log and wrap in parchment paper or plastic wrap.
            Chill for at least an hour. The dough can be frozen for two months or refrigerated for a week.
